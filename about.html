        <h2>👩‍🦱Personal Information</h2>
       <p>I'm <strong> Gelila Sintayehu, currently a third-year Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa University.
        <br> Right now, I'm on my journey to becoming a Web Developer — halfway through the Front-End side of things. This portfolio gives you everything you need to know about me. 
        <br>Hope you enjoy exploring it!</p>

        <h2>😃Aspiring On</h2>
        <p>Interested in both Front-End and Back-End, though my current focus is on Front-End development.
            <br> I'm also into Data Structures and Algorithms, 
            <br>and I actively practice competitive programming on LeetCode — solved quite a few problems there. I’ve been working as sells promotor in the <br>Tecno mobile.
            <br> Always open to learning more and growing to achieve my vision.</p>

        <p><strong>Addis Ababa University<br>
Bsc. in Software Engineering (will graduate in 2028)<br>

As a software engineering student at Addis Ababa University, I’ve completed courses in Programming Fundamentals,<br>
 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Computer Networking, and Database Systems so far. <br>
 Through these courses and various projects, I’ve developed strong skills in problem-solving, collaboration, and practical software development. <br>
 Beyond academics, university life has taught me valuable lessons in time management, hard work, social interaction, and living and working with people from diverse backgrounds.</p>

Programming Foundamentals

This program helped kick-start my front-end development journey. <br>
The courses are highly detailed and helped me understand basic concepts in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,<br>
and how the web works in general entirely from scratch. I gained a pretty good understanding of the web,<br>
front-end and I also completed some projects along the way. I successfully earned a certificate upon completion.</p>
